List 1: Central Tendencies


List 1: List Statistics

Mean of weight lifted: 207.08
Median of weight lifted: 200.0
Mode of weight lifted: 135
Variance of weight lifted: 3181.076
Standard deviation of weight lifted: 58.909

===============================================
Sometimes we may want to see if there are any        relationships between weight and number of reps.        This section will explain those relationships.
List 2: Lists-Correlation and Prediction

The correlation between weight and reps is: {0.75}
The slope of the best fit line is: {0.73}
The intercept of the best fit line is: {6.0}
Utilizng this information, our future reps at 155 lbs is: {17}

===============================================

List 3: Lists-Using Python Built-in Functions
The minimum weight was: [315, 310, 235, 225, 215, 205, 195, 185, 175, 155, 135, 135]      
The maximum weight was: 315
The number of sets done was: 12
The total weight lifted was: 2485
The average weight lifted was: 207.08333333333334
The weight set was: {225, 195, 135, 235, 155, 205, 175, 310, 215, 185, 315}
The sorted list for our weight was: [135, 135, 155, 175, 185, 195, 205, 215, 225, 235, 310, 315]
The descending sorted list for our weight was: [315, 310, 235, 225, 215, 205, 195, 185, 175, 155, 135, 135]

List 4: List methods

Lst: [7, 13, 21, 23, 56, 63, 99]
List with Appended [7, 13, 21, 23, 56, 63, 99, 3]
Extend lst: [7, 13, 21, 23, 56, 63, 99, 3, 22, 27, 35]
lst with insert: [7, 4, 13, 21, 23, 56, 63, 99, 3, 22, 27, 35]
List minus value 4: [7, 13, 21, 23, 56, 63, 99, 3, 22, 27, 35]
21 appears 1 times in lst.
lst sorted ascending: [3, 7, 13, 21, 22, 23, 27, 35, 56, 63, 99]
lst sorted descending: [99, 63, 56, 35, 27, 23, 22, 21, 13, 7, 3]
Copy of lst: [99, 63, 56, 35, 27, 23, 22, 21, 13, 7, 3]
The first value in our list is: 99
The last item on our list is: 3

===============================================

List 5: List Transformations- filter and map

The even weight ranges completed are: [310]

The weights utilized over 165 lbs was: [315, 310, 235, 225, 215, 205, 195, 185, 175]      If we tripled each weight utilized, we would have: [945, 930, 705, 675, 645, 615, 585, 555, 525, 465, 405, 405]If you need weights in kg for listw they are as follows: [142.88, 140.61, 106.59, 102.06, 97.52, 92.99, 88.45, 83.91, 79.38, 70.31, 61.23, 61.23]
